### Multivariate Data Analysis project
This is the folder that contains the code for the project on the Multivariate Data Analysis course.

The main aim of the project is to use machine learning to understand if it is possible to predict a song's popularity based on its lyrics.
I plan to achieve this through analyzing the words in a song and estimate Random Forest to predict if a song's page views will be above that of the 90th percentile.
